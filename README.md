## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Run the website locally**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Entry point is `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
