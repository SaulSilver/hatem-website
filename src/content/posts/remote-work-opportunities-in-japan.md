TLDR; Remote jobs in Japan ðŸ’» https://remotework.jp/

### Scene in Japan

Tokyo, as the capital of Japan, dominates the job opportunities within for web developers. As a Kansai region person (different region of Japan) itâ€™s rather difficult to find a good company within a reasonable distance from home. On top of that, the companies are quite limited.

Big companies exist in Kansai such as Rakuten, Line, Nintendo (gaming developers), etc. However, for someone who prefers smaller companies, itâ€™s a challenge to find proper opportunities within Kansai. So remote seems to be the way to go.

Moreover, remote work is the inevitable future of developers (and other careers). I have seen many people would be interested into remote work for various reasons.

Just that Japan takes a bit of time to adapt. This what brings us to this announcement.

## Announcement

https://remotework.jp

I just built a website to collect remote jobs within Japan that has just gone live with multiple Japanese companies offering remote work.

Iâ€™d like to thank Kazato Sugimoto and Yohei Yasukawa for the collaboration and getting this to what it is now.

Contribution on [GitHub](https://github.com/remote-jp/remote-in-japan) and spreading the word are much appreciated. ðŸš€
