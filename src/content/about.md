history: Created remotework.jp website, web developer and used to teach programming at at YouCode in Kyoto, Japan. I manage projects and build apps/websites. Software engineer appreciating teamwork, productive process and outcome. I enjoy multicultural and international workplaces.
interests: Currently living in Finland, after being around the world. Grew up in Egypt then moved to Sweden where I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Afterward, I moved to Kyoto, Japan where I did my exchange studies and worked for about 3.5 years. Being infused with multiple cultural backgrounds and a polyglot had me always curious about other cultures, languages and international communities. Aside from work and associated activities, I like spending time with family and friends, play guitar, football, workout or go for a walk.
