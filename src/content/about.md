page: about
history: Created remotework.jp website, web developer at Ship&co and mentor at YouCode. I manage projects and build apps/websites. Fullstack developer and freelancer specialized in Javascript technologies over the whole stack (Node.js, React, Vue, Meteor, MongoDB, REST & GraphQL APIs, JAMStack) to build web apps and websites.
interests: A bit more about me. Grew up in Egypt then moved to Sweden where I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Now, I am based in Kyoto, Japan. Being infused with multiple cultural backgrounds and a polyglot had me always curious about other cultures, languages and international communities. Aside from coding and work-related activities, I like to play guitar, go out with friends, play football, workout or cycle exploring Kyoto.
