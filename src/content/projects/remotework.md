I believe remote work should be available to tech employees as much as possible. Therefore, I contributed by creating this website; a list of tech remote work opportunities to boost the remote-work scene in Japan.

- Open-source available on <a href="https://github.com/remote-jp/remote-in-japan" target="_new">GitHub</a>
- Multilingual website in Japanese and English
- Built with Jekyll & SCSS supporting Dark and Light modes.
